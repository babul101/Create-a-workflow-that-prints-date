# Cross-Platform Date Printing Workflow

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow designed to demonstrate cross-platform date printing using different operating systems and runners.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow is triggered on pushes to the `main` branch. It consists of four jobs, each printing the current date using various operating systems and runners. Additionally, the fourth job creates a dependency on the completion of the first three jobs before executing.

### Jobs

1. **Ubuntu Latest Runner**
   - **Runner**: ubuntu-latest
   - **Prints**: Current date on Ubuntu environment

2. **Windows Latest Runner**
   - **Runner**: windows-latest
   - **Prints**: Current date on Windows environment

3. **MacOS Latest Runner**
   - **Runner**: macos-latest
   - **Prints**: Current date on macOS environment

4. **Custom Runner**
   - **Runner**: [Your custom runner here]
   - **Dependencies**: job1, job2, job3
   - **Prints**: Current date using the custom runner after the completion of the first three jobs.
